title: Data at Rest Full Disk Encryption

Data at rest full disk encryption is implemented at the IaaS level. 
The main purpose is to protect the data in the event the physical hard drives are compromised.
The disks are only readable with the appropriate encryption key. 
Therefore, full disk encryption provides a relatively easy means of protecting the data on the physical hard drives.
The main drawback is that once the disk is mounted and used, it is readable from the system on which it is mounted.
Consequently, this approach does not offer protection against an attack on a running server once mounted.
Data at rest full disk encryption is supported by the popular IaaS providers.
The process is IaaS specific, enabled on all disks used by that IaaS and explained in the Operations Manager documentation. [Here is the documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/security/pcf-infrastructure/disk-encrypt.html) that explains how to enable full disk encryption for each particular IaaS.
