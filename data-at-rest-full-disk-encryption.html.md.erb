## Overview on Rest Full-Disk Encryption

Data at rest full-disk encryption (FDE) protects data on the physical hard drives in case the drives are compromised.
The disks are only readable with the appropriate encryption key.

In <%= vars.product_full %>, data at rest full-disk encryption is implemented at the IaaS level.

## Considerations

Once a disk is mounted and used, it is readable from the system on which it is mounted.
Consequently, FDE does not offer protection against an attack on a running server after the disk has been mounted.

## Enabling Full-Disk Encryption

Data at rest FDE is supported by the popular IaaS providers.
FDE is enabled on all disks used by the IaaS.

The process is IaaS-specific. For information about enabling FDE for each IaaS, see the [Ops Manager documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/security-pcf-infrastructure-disk-encrypt.html).
