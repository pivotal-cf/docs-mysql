This topic tells you about how <%= vars.single_leader_plan_lc %> topology works in
<%= vars.product_full %> and contains information to help you decide whether to use
the <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> plan.

The <%= vars.single_leader_plan_lc %> topology in <%= vars.product_short %>
is a disaster recovery solution that enables developers to provision a leader-follower
instance across two foundations.
This leader-follower service instance is comprised of two single node instances
that are configured for replication.
Operators can configure two foundations to be in the same data center
or spread across multiple data centers or geographical regions.

The foundation types are:

* **Primary Foundation:** This foundation is deployed in your main data center.
Generally, this data center receives the majority of app traffic.
<%= vars.product_short %> assumes that the leader is deployed on this foundation when
healthy.

* **Secondary Foundation:** This foundation is deployed in your failover data center.
Generally, this data center receives less app traffic than the primary foundation,
or no traffic at all.
<%= vars.product_short %> assumes that the follower is deployed on this foundation unless
a developer triggers a failover.


<p> The <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> plan type is configured separately
  from the leader-follower service plan.
</p>

For information about enabling <%= vars.single_leader_plan %>,
see
[Preparing for <%= vars.single_leader_plan %>](./prepare-multi-site.html).

For information for developers about using <%= vars.single_leader_plan %>,
see
[Using <%= vars.product_short %> for <%= vars.single_leader_plan %>](./use-multi-site.html).

## <a id='benefits'></a> <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> benefits

The <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> plan has the following benefits:

* **Resilience for Service Instances:** Developers can trigger a failover
to maintain app uptime during a data center outage.
For more information,
see [Triggering <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> failover and switchover](./multi-site-trigger-failover.html).

* **Data Center Upgrades with Zero Downtime:** Operators can upgrade data centers
without taking databases offline by triggering a switchover first.

* **Support for Multiple Cloud Deployment Models:**
Operators can configure <%= vars.single_leader_plan_lc %> with a
single cloud or hybrid cloud deployment model.
Both deployment models have the same end-user experience.

+ **Support for Active-Passive and App-Layer Active-Active Disaster Recovery:**

and [About app-layer active-active topology](#active-active).


##<a id='active-passive'></a> Active-passive topology

In an active-passive topology, when all foundations and workloads are healthy,
all app traffic is directed to the primary foundation.
The secondary foundation receives no app traffic.

VMware recommends using this topology when your secondary foundation is scaled down,
generally inactive, and does not receive significant app traffic.

For information about active-passive failover and switchover,
see [About failover and switchover](#failover-switchover).

The following diagram describes the active-passive topology in a healthy state:

![alt-text=""](./images/active-passive.png)

<a href="./images/active-passive.png" target="_blank" aria-hidden="true">View a larger version of this diagram.</a>

In the preceding diagram:

* The global DNS load balancer (GLB) directs traffic to the app in the primary foundation.
  This app issues transactions to the leader service instance.
* The follower service instance in the secondary foundation continuously
replicates data from the leader service instance in the primary foundation.

##<a id='active-active'></a> App-layer active-active topology

In an app-layer active-active topology, when all foundations and workloads are healthy,
app traffic is directed to both the primary and secondary foundation.

VMware recommends using this topology when both your primary and secondary foundations
are scaled up and are expected to serve traffic.

For information about app-layer active-active failover and switchover,
see [About failover and switchover](#failover-switchover).

The following diagram describes the app-layer active-active topology in a healthy state:

![alt-text=""](./images/active-active.png)

In the preceding diagram:

* The GLB directs traffic to the apps in the primary and
  secondary foundations.
  The apps in the primary and secondary foundation issue transactions to the leader service instance. <br><br>
  The app in the secondary foundation issues transactions to the leader as below:
      1. Connects to the follower service instance
      2. Issues transactions to the follower service instance
      3. Forwards the transactions from the follower service instance to the leader

* The follower service instance in the secondary foundation continuously
replicates data from the leader service instance in the primary foundation.

<p class="note important">
<span class="note__title"> Important</span>  In the <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> plan,
the app-layer active-active topology does not enable multi-primary replication.
Therefore, the follower service instance is read-only.
Apps can only write to the leader.
</p>


## <a id='failover-switchover'></a> Failover and switchover

<%= vars.product_short %> prioritizes data consistency over availability.
Therefore, <%= vars.product_short %> does not trigger failover or switchover automatically
and developers must manually trigger a failover or switchover.
For instructions about triggering failover or switchover, see
see [Triggering <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> Failover and switchover](./multi-site-trigger-failover.html).

The following table describes when you can trigger a failover or switchover:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th width="50%">Failover if...</th>
    <th>Switchover if...</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>The leader MySQL process has crashed
          or is unhealthy and is not automatically recovered by BOSH.</li>
        <li>The leader VM is destroyed or unrecoverable.</li>
        <li>The availability zone (AZ) for the leader VM experiences an unexpected outage.</li>
        <li>The data center for the leader VM experiences an unexpected outage.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <tr>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>Both the leader and the follower instance are healthy. </li>
        <li>You plan to do foundation or data center upgrades or maintenance on your primary site.
          For example, upgrading stemcells or data center hardware.</li>
        <li>You plan to degrade performance on the primary site.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

and [About app-layer active-active topology](#active-active).

### <a id='failover'></a> Failover

In both the active-passive and app-layer active-active topologies,
if a developer triggers a failover,
all app traffic is directed to the leader in the secondary foundation
and the primary foundation receives no app traffic.

The following diagram describes what happens when you trigger a failover
for a <%= vars.single_leader_plan_lc %> topology:

![alt-text=""](./images/multi-site-failover.png)

<a href="./images/multi-site-failover.png" target="_blank" aria-hidden="true">View a larger version of this diagram.</a>

In the previous diagram:

* The GLB directs traffic to the app in the secondary foundation.
  This app issues transactions to the leader service instance in the secondary foundation.
* The leader service instance in the secondary foundation does not replicate data to another
service instance.

### <a id=active-passive-switchover></a> Active-passive switchover

In an active-passive topology, if a developer triggers a switchover,
all app traffic is directed to the leader in the secondary foundation.
The primary foundation receives no app traffic.

The following diagram describes what happens when you trigger a switchover
in an active-passive topology:

![alt-text=""](./images/active-passive-switchover.png)

<a href="./images/active-passive-switchover.png" target="_blank" aria-hidden="true">View a larger version of this diagram.</a>

In the preceding diagram:

* The GLB directs traffic to the app in the secondary foundation.
  This app issues transactions to the leader service instance in the secondary foundation.
* The leader service instance in the secondary foundation replicates data to the follower service
instance in the primary foundation.

### <a id=active-active-switchover></a> App-layer active-active switchover

If a developer triggers a switchover,
app traffic is still directed to both the primary and secondary foundation.
However, the leader service instance is in secondary foundation.

The following diagram describes what happens when you trigger a switchover
in an active-active topology:

![alt-text=""](./images/active-active-switchover.png)

  secondary foundations.
  The apps in the primary and secondary foundation issue transactions to the leader service instance
  in the secondary foundation. <br><br>
  The app in the primary foundation issues transactions to the leader:
      1. Connects to the follower service instance.
      1. Issues transactions to the follower service instance.
      1. Forwards the transactions from the follower service instance to the leader.

* The follower service instance in the primary foundation continuously
replicates data from the leader service instance in the secondary foundation

## <a id='infrastructure'></a> Infrastructure requirements for <%= vars.single_leader_plan %>

Before you use the <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> plan, consider the following requirements.

### <a id='capacity'></a> Capacity planning

When calculating IaaS usage, you must take into account that each
<%= vars.single_leader_plan %> instance requires two VMs.
Therefore, the resources used for <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> plan is
twice the amount of single node plan.

For more information,
see [Setting limits for on-demand service instances](.//set-quotas.html) and
[Persistent Disk Usage](./recommended.html#persistent).

### <a id='network'></a> Networking requirements

You must consider the <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> instances that are deployed in
data centers are a geographically farther apart experience higher latencies.

For information about the standard networking rules,
see [Required Networking Rules for <%= vars.single_leader_plan %>](./about.html#multi-site-ports).


## <a id='limitations'></a> <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> limitations

The <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> plan has the following limitation:

<p class="note important">
<span class="note__title"> Important</span> Synchronous replication is not supported. For multi‑site
replication plans, any data that is written to the leader is asynchronously replicated to the follower.</p>
