title: Installing and configuring VMware SQL with MySQL for Tanzu Application Service
owner: MySQL
---

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

You can install, configure, and deploy the <%= vars.product_full %> tile.  The
<%= vars.product_short %> service enables you to create and use MySQL
service instances on demand.

## <a id="rbac"></a>Role-based access in <%= vars.ops_manager %>

<%= vars.ops_manager %> admins can use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage which
operators can make deployment changes, view credentials, and manage user roles in <%= vars.ops_manager %>.

Your role permissions might not permit you to do every procedure in this topic.

For more information about roles in <%= vars.ops_manager %>, see
    <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/opsguide-config-rbac.html#roles-in-ops-manager-1">
        Roles in <%= vars.ops_manager %></a>.</p>

## <a id="prereq"></a> Prerequisites

Before you install the <%= vars.product_short %> tile, you must:

+ [Create an app security group for <%= vars.product_short %>](#asg).
+ [Enable the BOSH Resurrector](#resurrector).
+ [Prepare for TLS](./prepare-tls.html). Required to enable TLS and required for <%=vars.single_leader_plan %>
  and HA cluster plans.
+ [Prepare for <%= vars.single_leader_plan %>](./prepare-multi-site.html): Only required if you
want to replicate data across multiple foundations or data centers.

### <a id="asg"></a> Create an app security group for <%= vars.product_short %>

To enable apps running on <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> to communicate with the MySQL service network,
you must create an App Security Group (ASG).
The ASG enables smoke tests to run when you first install the <%= vars.product_short %> service
and apps to access the service after it is installed.

To create an ASG for <%= vars.product_short %>:

1. Go to **<%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard** > **BOSH Director**.

1. Click **Create Networks**.

1. Click your services network and record the **CIDR**.

    ![alt-text="In the 'Create Networks' pane, in the 'Networks' section the 'services'
    network is expanded. The 'Name', 'Google Network Name', and 'CIDR', fields are shown."](./images/opsman-dir-reserved-ips.png)

2. Create a JSON file named `mysql-asg.json` using the following template:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "protocol": "tcp",
        "destination": "CIDR",
        "ports": "3306"
      }
    ]
    ```

    Where `CIDR` is the CIDR that you recorded in the previous step.

3. Create an ASG by running:

    ```console
    cf create-security-group p.mysql ./mysql-asg.json
    ```

4. Bind the ASG to all running apps by running:

     ```console
    cf bind-running-security-group p.mysql
    ```

For more information about ASGs,
see [App security groups in Cloud Foundry](<https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/><%= vars.current_major_version %>/tas-for-vms/asg.html#asg-individua).

### <a id="resurrector"></a> Enabling the BOSH Resurrector

VMware recommends activating the BOSH Resurrector when installing <%= vars.product_short %>.
The BOSH Resurrector increases the availability of <%= vars.product_short %> by restarting and resuming MySQL service.

The BOSH Resurrector does the following:

+ Reacts to hardware failures and network disruptions by restarting VMs on active, stable hosts.
+ Detects operating system failures by continuously monitoring VMs and restarts them as required.
+ Continuously monitors the BOSH Agent running on each service instance VM and restarts the VM as required.

For more information about the BOSH Resurrector,
see [BOSH Resurrector](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/install-resurrector.html#bosh-resurrector-0).

 To enable the BOSH Resurrector:

1. Go to **<%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard** > **BOSH Director**.

2. Click **Director Config**.

3. Select the **Enable VM Resurrector Plugin** check box.

4. Click **Save**.

## <a id="install"></a> Download and import the tile

To download and import the <%= vars.product_short %> tile:

1. Download the product file
from [<%= vars.product_network %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-mysql/).

1. Go to the **<%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard** and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file.

1. Under **Import a Product**, click **+** next to the version number of <%= vars.product_short %>.
   This adds the tile to your staging area.

1. Click the newly-added **<%= vars.product_short %>** tile to open its configuration panes.

    ![alt-text="On the left side of the image, 'Assign AZs and Networks' is selected.
    The 'AZ and Network Assignments' configuration pane is shown.
    See the following section for a description of the fields in this pane."](./images/config-azs.png)

## <a id="config-on-demand"></a> Configure the tile

To configure the <%= vars.product_short %> tile, do the following procedures.

### <a id="azs"></a> Configure AZs and networks

To configure an availability zone (AZ) to run the service broker
and networks for the broker and MySQL service instances:

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks**.

1. Configure the fields as follows:

  <table>
    <tr><th>Field</th><th>Instructions</th></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Place singleton jobs in</strong></td>
        <td>Select the AZ that you want the MySQL broker VM to run in. The broker runs as a singleton job.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Balance other jobs in</strong></td>
        <td>Ignore; not used.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Network</strong></td>
        <td>Select a subnet for the MySQL broker. This is typically the same subnet
            that includes the <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) component VMs.<br>
            This network is represented by the Default Network in diagram in <a href="./about.html#on-demand">Default network and service network</a>.
            </td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Service Network</strong></td>
        <td>Select the subnet for the on-demand service instances.
          This network is represented by the Service Network in diagram in <a href="./about.html#on-demand">Default Network and Service Network</a>.
            <br><br>
            If you are adding IPsec to encrypt MySQL communication, VMware recommends that you deploy MySQL to its own network
            to avoid conflicts with services that are not IPsec compatible.
         </td></tr>
  </table>
          <p> You cannot change the regions or networks
          after you <strong>Apply Changes</strong>.</p>

3. Click **Save**.

### <a id="active"></a> Configure service plans

<%= vars.product_short %> enables you to configure as many as 18 service plans.
Each service plan has a corresponding section in the tile configuration, such as **Plan 1**, **Plan 2**, and so on.

By default, plans 1 through 3 are active and plans 4 through 9 are inactive.
The following procedures describe how to change these defaults.

<p> You must not set <strong>Plan 1</strong> to <strong>Inactive</strong>.
  If you deactivate <strong>Plan 1</strong>, your installation fails when you apply changes.
</p>

#### <a name="one-node-plans"></a> About creating plans for restoring multi-node service instances

If you offer leader-follower or highly available (HA) cluster plans,
then you must configure single-node or <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> plans that can be used
to restore a multi-node plan from backup.

<table class="nice">
<col width="33%">
 <tr>
  <th>If you offer service plans of type…</th>
  <th>Then configure a service plan of type…</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>leader-follower</td>
  <td>single node, with the persistent disk as large
                    as the largest leader-follower plan offered.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>HA cluster</td>
  <td><%= vars.single_leader_plan %>, with the persistent disk as large
                    as the largest HA cluster plan offered.</td>
 </tr>
</table>

For information about how multi-node service instances are restored,
see <a href="./backup-restore.html#restore">Restore a service instance</a>
in <em>backing up and restoring <%= vars.product_full %></em>.

### Procedure for configuring service plans

For each plan that you want to use in your deployment:

1. Click the section for the plan. For example, **Plan 1**.

1. Select the plan for your desired topology.

    ![alt-text="The Plan' section is shown. The radio button for 'Inactive' is selected."](./images/plan-types-3-0.png)

    The following tabs expand to show an example image  of each plan:

    <style>
    .tab {
        overflow: hidden;
        border: 1px solid #ccc;
        background-color: #f1f1f1;
    }

    /*Style the buttons that are used to open the tabcontent*/
    .tab button {
        background-color: inherit;
        float: left;
        border: inherit;
        outline: none;
        cursor: pointer;
        padding: ;
        transition: 0.3s;
    }

    /*Change background color of buttons on hover*/
    .tab button :hover {
        background-color: #ddd;
    }

    /*Create an active/current tablink class*/
    .tab button.active {
        background-color: #ccc;
    }

    /*Style the tab content*/
    .tabcontent {
        display: none;
        padding: 6px 12px;
        border: 1px solid #ccc;
        border-top: none;
    }
    </style>

    <script>
    function openDocs(evt, docsName) {
        // Declare all variables
        var i, tabcontent, tablinks;
        // Get all elements with class="tabcontent" and hide them
        tabcontent = document.getElementsByClassName("tabcontent");

        for (i = 0; i < tabcontent.length; i++) {
            tabcontent[i].style.display = "none";
        }

        // Get all elements with class="tablinks" and remove the class "active"
        tablinks = document.getElementsByClassName("tablinks");

        for (i = 0; i < tablinks.length; i++) {
            tablinks[i].className = tablinks[i].className.replace(" active", "");
        }

        // Show the current tab, and add an "active" class to the button that opened the tab
        document.getElementById(docsName).style.display = "block";
        evt.currentTarget.className += " active";
    }
    </script>

    <div class="tab">
      <!- Tab headers and links ->

4. Click Save.

<p> If you expect your developers
  to upgrade from one plan to another, do not place the plans in separate AZs.
  For example, if you create Plan 1 in AZ1 and Plan 2 in AZ2, developers receive
  an error and cannot continue if they try to upgrade from Plan 1 to Plan 2. This
  prevents them from losing their data by orphaning their disk in AZ1.<br><br>
  If you need to manually migrate the data from one AZ to another, see
  <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-SQL-with-MySQL-for-Tanzu-Application-Service/2.10/mysql-for-tas/index.html">About data migration in <%= vars.product_short %></a>.

1. Configure the fields as follows:

  <table>
    <tr><th>Field</th><th>Instructions</th></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Enable Lower Case Table Names</strong></td>
        <td>Select this check box to store all table names in lowercase.
            This sets the MySQL server system variable
            <code>lower_case_table_names</code> to <code>1</code> on all <%= vars.product_short %> instances by default. <br>

### <a id="backups"></a> Configure backups

To learn how backups work, see [About backups](./backup-restore.html#about-backups).

You must configure backups. You cannot deactivate this feature.
To configure backups:

1. Click **Backups**.

  ![alt-text="The radio buttons for backup configuration are Ceph or Amazon S3, Amazon S3 (with Instance Profiles), SCP, GCS, and Azure."](./images/backups.png)

1. Select a **Backup configuration** and follow the procedure for your storage solution
in the *Configuring Automated Backups* topic:

  + **Ceph or Amazon S3:** <%= vars.product_short %> runs an [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/s3/) client
      that saves backups to an S3 bucket,
      a [Ceph](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/) storage cluster, or another S3-compatible endpoint certified by VMware.<br>
      For instructions about using Ceph or Amazon S3 for backups, see [Back Up to Ceph or S3](./automated-backup.html#ceph-or-s3).
  + **Amazon S3 (with Instance Profiles):** <%= vars.product_short %> runs an [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/s3/) client
      that saves backups to an S3 bucket. This options uses an [Amazon Instance Profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html)
      instead of static credentials for backup and restore. For instructions about using Amazon S3 (with Instance Profiles),
      see [Amazon S3 (with Instance Profiles)](./automated-backup.html.md.erb#instance-profile).
  + **SCP:** <%= vars.product_short %> runs an Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) command that secure-copies backups to a VM
      or physical machine operating outside of your deployment. This is the fastest option. <br>
      SCP enables you to securely transfer files between two hosts.
      You can provision the backup machine separately from your installation.

### <a id="security"></a> Configure security

To configure the security settings for the MySQL service, do one or both:

+ Enable TLS for the MySQL service. See [Configure TLS](#security-tls).
+ Store your service instance credentials in runtime CredHub. See [Configure secure service instance credentials](#security-service-instance-creds).

![alt-text="The Security pane. The following TLS Options are listed: Not Configured,
Optional - Developers can configure their service VMs to use TLS, and
Required - All connections MUST use TLS.
Any application that is not using TLS communication with MySQL breaks."](./images/security.png)

#### <a id="security-tls"></a> Configure TLS

To activate TLS for the MySQL service:

1. Do the procedures in [Preparing for TLS](prepare-tls.html).

1. Click **Security**.
1. For **Enforce application TLS**, select one of the following:
    <table class="nice">
      <col width="30%">
      <tr><th>State</th><th>Instructions</th></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Unchecked</strong></td>
          <td>This enables developers to configure their MySQL service VMs to use TLS.
            <br><br>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Accept only TLS v1.2 connections:</strong> Selecting this check box enforces TLS v1.2
                as the minimum TLS version for client connections.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Checked</strong></td>
          <td>This enables developers to configure their MySQL service VMs to use TLS
            and requires all MySQL service VMs to only accept secure connections.
            <br><br>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Accept only TLS v1.2 connections:</strong> Selecting this check box enforces TLS v1.2
                as the minimum TLS version for client connections.
              </li>
            </ul>
          <p> Selecting <strong>Required</strong> breaks any
            apps that are not currently connecting over TLS.</p>
          </td></tr>
    </table>

    Enforcing TLS v1.2 has the following effects:
      <ul>
        <li>For apps using MySQL Connector/J 5.1.44 and earlier, apps might break.</li>
        <li>For apps using MySQL Connector/J 5.1.44 to 5.1.48, developers have to rebind the apps.</li>
      </ul>
      The TLS v1.2 restriction is a global setting, so it applies to every service instance.
      Any apps in the foundation using an old version of MySQL Connector/J fail to connect to MySQL after this new setting is applied.
1. Click **Save**.
1. After you deploy the tile, notify your developers that they must activate TLS for their service instances and activate TLS for their apps.
See [Using TLS](using-tls.html).

#### <a id="security-service-instance-creds"></a> Configure secure service instance credentials

You can store your service instance credentials in runtime CredHub instead of the Cloud Controller database (CCDB).
For more information about runtime CredHub, see [CredHub](<https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/><%= vars.current_major_version %>/tas-for-vms/credhub-index.html).

To store your service instance credentials in runtime CredHub:

1. Ensure that you have configured the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile to support securing service instance credentials in runtime CredHub.
   For instructions, see [Step 1: Configure the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile](<https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/><%= vars.current_major_version %>/tas-for-vms/secure-si-creds.html#pas-config).
1. Click **Security**.
1. Select the **Enable Secure Service Instance Credentials** check box.
1. Click **Save**.
1. After you deploy the tile, notify the developers that they must unbind and rebind any existing service instances bindings if they want to use secure service instance credentials. Developers must:

    1. Unbind the service instance from the app by running:

        ```
        cf unbind-service APP SERVICE-INSTANCE
        ```

    2. Rebind the service instance to the app by running:

        ```
        cf bind-service PP SERVICE-INSTANCE
        ```

    3. Restart the app to apply the new binding by running:

        ```
        cf restart APP
        ```

    4. Verify that the binding includes CredHub pointers in the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable by running:

        ```
        cf env APP
        ```

        For example:
        <pre class="terminal">$ cf env my-app
        Getting env variables for app my-app in org system / space example as admin...
        OK
        System-Provided:
        {
         "VCAP_SERVICES": {
          "p.mysql": [
           {
            "credentials": {
             "credhub-ref": "/c/548966e5-e333-4d65-8773-7b4e3bb6ca97/4a246b0b-83bb-46d0-b8ac-35a93374ae67/caf6e32e-7361-4869-9a57-54ab8ae67b3f/credentials"
            },
        [...]
        </pre>

### <a id="errands"></a> Review errands (Optional)

Errands are scripts that run at specific times to do various tasks.
<%= vars.product_short %> can run errands to manage the broker and service instances.
You do not need to change the default configurations for errands.

<p> The <strong>Delete All Service Instances and Deregister Broker</strong> errand does
necessary cleanup tasks when you delete the <%= vars.product_short %> tile or re-define plans. Setting this errand to <strong>Off</strong> can cause
problems when attempting to install the tile again or re-define plans. VMware recommends that you do not set this errand to <strong>Off</strong>.
</p>

<%= vars.product_short %> uses the following types of errands:

+ **Post-Deploy Errands:** These errands run when you click **Apply Changes**.
+ **Pre-Delete Errands:** These errands run before you delete the <%= vars.product_short %> tile.

<%= vars.product_short %> also uses errands to configure leader-follower service instances.
For more information about leader-follower errands, see <a href="./errands.html">Errands</a>.

You can use errands when troubleshooting the broker or service instances.
For more information about using errands for troubleshooting, see [Run Service
Broker Errands to Manage Brokers and Instances](./troubleshoot.html#broker-errands).
