<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

You can control access to service plans by org.
You can also set limits for the number of service intances globally and per plan.

For more information, see [Setting limits for on-demand instances](./set-quotas.html).

## <a id="service-plan-access"></a> Control access to service plan by orgs

You are able to control which CF orgs are able to access specific service plans in <%= vars.product_full %>.
By default, active service plans are visible to all orgs.
Controlling which orgs have access to a specific service plan enables you to ensure
that the resource-intensive service plans are only available to the orgs that explicitly need them.

To configure <%= vars.product_short %> to control service-plan access, do the following:

1. Set the **Service Plan Access** field to **Manual** on any active service plan.

    For more information, see [Configure active service plans](./install-config.html#active).

1. Click **Save**.

1. Return to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard and click **Review Pending Changes**.

1. Click **Apply Changes**.

1. For each org that you want to use the service plan, do the following:

    1.  Log in to the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) as an admin user:

        <code>cf login</code>

    1.  Activate service access to the org:

        <code>cf enable-service-access p.mysql -p PLAN -o ORGANIZATION</code>

        Where:

        * `PLAN`: The name of the specific plan to enable, set to manual in step 1.

        * `ORGANIZATION`: The name of the org that needs access to `PLAN`.

        For example,

        <pre class="terminal">
        $ cf enable-service-access p.mysql -o prodteam -p db-large
        Enabling access to plan db-large of service p.mysql for org prodteam as admin...
        OK
        </pre>

The org can now use the plan.
