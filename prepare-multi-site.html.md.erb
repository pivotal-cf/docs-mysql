You can prepare foundations for
<%= vars.single_leader_plan_lc %> using <%= vars.product_full %>.

For information about multi-site architecture,
see [About <%= vars.single_leader_plan %>](./about-multi-site.html).

##<a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

Before you configure <%= vars.single_leader_plan_lc %> for <%= vars.product_short %>, you must
confirm that you have done the following:

1. Created two <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) foundations that support
      a current version of <%= vars.product_short %>.

1. Deployed both foundations on a routable network. For example, the leader and follower service instances must be
able to connect to each other on their respective IP addresses.
You must verify that the CIDR ranges for the leader and follower nodes do not overlap.

1. Determined which of the following disaster recovery strategies you want to use for your foundations:
    For more information, see [About active-passive topology](./about-multi-site.html#active-passive).
      and [About App-Layer Active-Active topology](./about-multi-site.html#active-active).

1. Configured a global DNS load balancer to point to the two <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> foundations
and their local load balancers.
For more information, see [Configure your GLB](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/refarch-global-dns-lb.html).

## <a id='enable'></a> Enabling <%= vars.single_leader_plan %>

After two <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> foundations are created, you can enable <%= vars.single_leader_plan_lc %> by
doing the following:

1. Configure networking rules.
For more information on network rules, see [Required networking rules for <%= vars.single_leader_plan %>](./about.html#multi-site-ports).

1. Enable TLS for both foundations. When you paste the contents of your TLS CA certificate in [Preparing for TLS](./prepare-tls.html), paste both TLS CA certificates as shown in the following image:

  ![alt-text="On the Security pane in the MySQL tile, the TLS CA certificates for the two different foundations are in the Trusted Certificates field."](./images/multi-site-ca.png)


1. Configure a <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> plan on both foundations. See
[Configure service plans](./install-config.html#active).
