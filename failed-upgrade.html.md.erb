This topic provides instructions for updating HA service instances from Percona 5.7 plans to Percona 8.0 plans and help with troubleshooting and fixing any problems.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

Service instance updates from Percona 5.7 plans to Percona 8.0 plans require a little planning to ensure success.
There is no downgrade path from 8.0 to 5.7 therefore please take the following steps.
[Follow the steps to backup your service instance](./backup-restore.html.md.erb)
[Check the health of cluster](monitor-health.html.md.erb)
Do not perform an update of an HA cluster unless all 3 nodes are reporting as healthy.
Upgrade service instances by following the [instructions for updating all service instances](./upgrade.html.md.erb) or the [instructions for update an individual service instance's plan](./upgrade.html#change-plan)

There are 2 potential scenarios that can arise from a failed update-service
- [A cluster of nodes with only 5.7 instances](#only-5-7)
  - One of the instances gets updated and the other two instances do not respond to it
- [A cluster of nodes with some or all 8.0 instances](#some-8-0)
  - One of the instances gets upgraded to 8.0 successfully, and communicates with the cluster
   - A either the second or third instance gets upgraded and fails before or after it is fully upgraded to 8.0

## <a id="only-5-7"></a>A cluster of nodes with only 5.7 instances
rerun the update service command
```
cf update-service SERVICE-INSTANCE -p PLAN-WITH-8.0
```

## <a id="some-8-0"></a> A cluster of nodes with some or all 8.0 instances
The remaining 5.7 instances must be redeployed using bosh deploy
1. **Manual Redeploy:** If any of the instances are still Percona 5.7,
   then redeploy the <code>mysqld</code> software to that node as follows:

2. Target BOSH on your bootstrap node by instructing it to ignore the other nodes in your cluster.
   For nodes all nodes except the bootstrap node you identified above, run:

      ```
      bosh -e YOUR-ENV -d YOUR-DEPLOYMENT ignore mysql/M
      bosh -e YOUR-ENV -d YOUR-DEPLOYMENT ignore mysql/N
      ```

   Where `N` and `M` are the numbers of the nodes to be ignored.
   For example, if you're manually updating node 0, then `M`=1 and `N`=2.

1. Turn off the BOSH Resurrector by running:

      ```
      bosh update-resurrection off
      ```

2. Use the BOSH manifest to update the instance by running:

      ```
      bosh -e YOUR-ENV -d YOUR-DEPLOYMENT manifest > /tmp/manifest.yml
      ```
   Using a text editor, manually modify the `mysql_version` property from "5.7" to "8.0". The full path of the property is `/instance_groups/name=mysql/jobs/name=pxc-mysql/properties/mysql_version?`
      ```
      bosh -e YOUR-ENV -d YOUR-DEPLOYMENT deploy /tmp/manifest.yml
      ```
