<%# 
The following partial content uses two optional local variables:

maestro_incompatible (BOOLEAN): 'false' by default. If set to 'true', 
Maestro is incompatible with the current service tile version. 
v2.9 and v2.10 procedures use the original procedure. 

compatible_om_versions (ARRAY OF STRINGS): Sets which Ops Manager versions are compatible 
with the current service tile. If defined, filters 
list of recommended links based on compatible versions. For example, ["2.7", "2.8"] 
shows only procedures for v2.7 and v2.8.

If your service tile is compatible with Maestro and is compatible with 
v2.7, v2.8, v2.9, and v2.10, you do not need to set any local variables.


For information about procedure compatibility, see the following Google document titled 
"Services TLS CA Rotation Links":

To rotate the Services TLS CA and its leaf certificates, 
use one of the following procedures:

<ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Ops Manager v2.10:</strong> See 
      <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-10/security/pcf-infrastructure/advanced-certificate-rotation.html#services-rotation">Rotating the Services TLS CA and Its Leaf Certificates</a>.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Ops Manager v2.9:</strong> See 
      <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-9/security/pcf-infrastructure/advanced-certificate-rotation.html#services-rotation">Rotating the Services TLS CA and Its Leaf Certificates</a>.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Ops Manager v2.8:</strong> See 
    <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-8/security/pcf-infrastructure/services_tls_ca_rotate.html">Rotating the Services TLS CA and Its Leaf Certificates</a>.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Ops Manager v2.7:</strong> See 
    <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-7/security/pcf-infrastructure/services_tls_ca_rotate.html">Rotating the Services TLS CA and Its Leaf Certificates</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
</ul>

Ops Manager v2.9 and later is compatible with CredHub Maestro.
<%= vars.product_short %> v2.8 and later is compatible with CredHub Maestro.
