This topic provides techniques that app developers can use to begin troubleshooting
 on-demand instances.

## <a id="errors"></a> Troubleshoot Errors

Start here if you are responding to a specific error or error messages.

### <a id="x-product"></a> Common Service Errors

<%# The below partial is in https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-partials %>

<%= partial '/services-tshoot/tshoot-no-metrics' %>

### <a id="inaccessible"></a>If Instances or Database are Inaccessible

You might experience the following in a leader-follower or <%= vars.single_leader_plan %>
topology, or during upgrades:

- [Temporary Outages](#outages)
- [Apps Cannot Write to the Database](#read-only)
- [Apps Are Inoperable](#disk-full)
- [Apps Cannot Connect to the Database](#m-tls-error)
- [MySQL Connector/J v5.1.41 or Earlier](#connecter)
- [Mutual TLS](#m-tls)

    solution: 'For more information, see <a href="./upgrade.html#interruptions">Service Interruptions</a>.'
} %>


<%= partial  "/troubleshoot-template", locals: {
    id: 'read-only',
    description: 'Apps Cannot Write to the Database',
    symptom: "You have a leader-follower or #{vars.single_leader_plan} topology, and your apps can no
    longer write to the database.",
    cause: "<p>If you have a leader-follower topology, the leader VM might be read-only. 
    If you can no longer read to the database as well, your persistent disk might be full.</p>
    <p>If you have a #{vars.single_leader_plan} topology, your leader VM might be down.</p>",
    solution: "<p>If you have a leader-follower topology and the leader VM is read-only, for how to 
    troubleshoot this problem, see <a href='./troubleshoot.html#both-read-only'>
        Both Leader and Follower Instances Are Read-Only</a>.</p>
    <p>If your apps can no longer read to the database as well,
    your persistent disk might be full. For more information about
    troubleshooting inoperable apps, see <a href='#disk-full'>
        Apps are Inoperable</a>.</p>
    <p>If you have a #{vars.single_leader_plan} topology and your leader VM is down, 
    to resolve this issue, you can trigger a failover to the follower VM.

## <a id="techniques"></a> Techniques for Troubleshooting

See the following sections for troubleshooting techniques when using
the Cloud Foundry Command-Line Interface (cf CLI) to perform basic
operations on a <%= vars.product_short %> service instance.

Basic cf CLI operations include `create`, `update`, `bind`, `unbind`, and `delete`.


### <a id="parse-error"></a>Understand a Cloud Foundry (CF) Error Message

<!-- The below partial is in https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-partials -->

<%= partial '/services-tshoot/tshoot-tech-parse-error' %>

### <a id="instance"></a> Find Information about Your Service Instance

You might need to find the name, GUID, or other information about a service instance.
To find this information, do the following:

1. Log into the space containing the instance or failed instance.
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf login
    </pre>

1. If you do not know the name of the service instance, run `cf services` to see a listing of all service instances in the space.
The service instances are listed in the `name` column.
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf services
    Getting services in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    name          service      plan        bound apps    last operation
    my-instance   p.mysql      db-small                  create succeeded
    </pre>

1. To retrieve more information about a specific instance, run `cf service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME`

1. To retrieve the GUID of the instance, run `cf service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME --guid`

   The GUID is useful for debugging.
