<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

You can use these instructions to establish an SSH tunnel connection to a
<%= vars.product_full %> service instance from outside a deployment.

<p> In general, the preferred method to connect to a service instance from outside your deployment
is through service-gateway access.
For information, see <a href="create-service-gateway-instance.html">Creating a Service Instance with Service-Gateway Access</a>.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview on using SSH to Connect Outside a Deployment

You might want to use an SSH tunnel in the following cases:

+ Connecting from a local workstation. For more information, see [<%= vars.product_short %> Tools](./tools.html).
+ Connecting from outside where your <%= vars.product_short %> service instance is located.
+ Connecting from a legacy app that is not in your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment.
+ Taking a manual backup to be stored locally.
  For more information, see [Backing Up and Restoring with mysqldump](./backup-mysqldump.html).

Any app deployed within your deployment can resolve BOSH DNS hostnames and forward
traffic to MySQL service instances using an SSH tunnel.

##<a id='prereq'></a> Prerequisite

To connect using an SSH tunnel, you must have SSH access to app containers.
For more information,
see [Configuring SSH access for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/3.0/tas-for-vms/config-ssh.html).

##<a id='procedure'></a> Procedure

To connect to a MySQL instance using an SSH tunnel,
follow the procedures in
[Accessing Services with SSH](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/4.0/tas-for-vms/deploy-apps-ssh-services.html#ssh-tunnel).
