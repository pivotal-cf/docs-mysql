<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to configure automated, physical backups for <%= vars.product_full %>.

Additionally, when they want, developers can create physical backups using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI)
or logical backups using `mysqldump`.
For more information about physical backups, see
[Backing Up and Restoring <%= vars.product_full %>](./backup-restore.html).
For more information about logical backups, see
[Backing Up and Restoring with mysqldump](./backup-mysqldump.html).

You can restore a physical backup by following the procedures in
[Restore a Service Instance](./backup-restore.html#restore).

## <a id="enable-backups"></a> About Configuring Automated Backups

You can configure <%= vars.product_short %> to automatically back up databases to external storage.
<%= vars.product_short %> backs up the entire data directory for each service instance.

<%= vars.product_short %> backs up your database on a schedule.
You configure this schedule with a cron expression.

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Configuring a cron expression overrides the default schedule for your service instance.
  <br><br>
  Developers can override the default for their service instance.
  For more information, see <a href="./change-default.html#backup-schedule">Backup Schedule</a>.
</p>

To configure backups, follow the procedure for your external storage solution:

+ [Back Up Using SCP](#scp)
+ [Back Up to Amazon S3 or Ceph](#ceph-or-s3)
+ [Back Up to GCS](#gcs)
+ [Back Up to Azure Storage](#azure)

## <a id="scp"></a> Back Up Using SCP

Secure copy protocol (SCP) enables operators to use any storage solution
on the destination VM. This is the fastest method for backing up your database.

When you configure backups with SCP,
<%= vars.product_short %> runs an SCP command that uses SFTP to securely copy backups to a VM
or physical machine operating outside of your deployment.
The operator provisions the backup machine separately from their installation.

To back up your database using SCP:

+ [Create a Public and Private Key Pair](#scp-keys)
+ [Configure Backups in <%= vars.ops_manager %>](#configure-scp)

### <a id="scp-keys"></a> Create a Public and Private Key&#8209;Pair

<%= vars.product_short %> accesses a remote host as a user with a private key for authentication.
VMware recommends that this user and key-pair is only used for <%= vars.product_short %>.

1. Determine the remote host that you use to store backups for <%= vars.product_short %>.
   Ensure that the MySQL service instances can access the remote host.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: VMware recommends using a VM outside your deployment
      for the destination of SCP backups. As a result,
      you might need to enable public IPs for the MySQL VMs.
    </p>

1. (Recommended) Create a new user for <%= vars.product_short %> on the destination VM.

1. (Recommended) Create a new public and private key-pair for authenticating as the above user
on the destination VM.

### <a id="configure-scp"></a> Configure Backups in <%= vars.ops_manager %>

Use <%= vars.ops_manager %> to configure <%= vars.product_short %> to back up using SCP.

1. In <%= vars.ops_manager %>, open the <%= vars.product_short %> tile **Backups** pane.

1. Select **SCP**.<br/>

    <img alt="Backup configuration pane shows SCP radio button selected and the fields
     in the pane are described in the table below."
      width="500" src="./images/scp-backups.png"/>

1. Configure the fields as follows:

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Field</th>
            <th>Instructions</th>
        </tr>

## <a id="ceph-or-s3"></a> Back Up to Amazon S3 or Ceph

When you configure backups for Amazon S3 or Ceph,
<%= vars.product_short %> runs an Amazon S3 client that saves the backups to one of the following:

+ an Amazon S3 bucket
+ a Ceph storage cluster
+ another S3-compatible endpoint certified by VMware

For information about Amazon S3 buckets,
see the [Amazon documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/s3/).
For information about Ceph storage clusters,
see the [Ceph documentation](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/).

To back up your database to Amazon S3 or Ceph:

+ [Create a Custom Policy and Access Key](#access-key-aws)
+ [Configure Backups in <%= vars.ops_manager %>](#configure-aws)

### <a id="access-key-aws"></a> Create a Custom Policy and Access Key

<%= vars.product_short %> accesses your S3 bucket through a user account.
VMware recommends that this account is only used by <%= vars.product_short %>.
You must apply a minimal policy that enables the user account upload backups to your S3 bucket.

Give the policy the permission to list and upload to buckets.

The procedure in this section assumes that you are using an Amazon S3 bucket.
If you are using a Ceph or another S3-compatible bucket to create the policy and access key,
follow the documentation for your storage solution.
For more information about Ceph S3 bucket policies,
see the [Ceph documentation](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/radosgw/bucketpolicy/).

To create a policy and access key in AWS:

1. Create a policy for your <%= vars.product_short %> user account.

    In AWS, create a new custom policy by following this procedure in the
    [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create-console.html#access_policies_create-json-editor).

    Paste in the following permissions:

    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Sid": "MySQLBackupPolicy",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
            "s3:ListBucket",
            "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
            "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
            "s3:PutObject"
          ],
          "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:s3:::MY_BUCKET_NAME/*",
            "arn:aws:s3:::MY_BUCKET_NAME"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

1. Record the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key user credentials for a new user account by
following this procedure in
the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html#id_users_create_console).
Ensure you select **Programmatic access**
and **Attach existing policies to user directly**. You must attach the policy you created in
the previous step.

### <a id="configure-aws"></a> Configure Backups in <%= vars.ops_manager %>

Use <%= vars.ops_manager %> to connect <%= vars.product_short %> to your S3 account.

**Prerequisite:** Before beginning this procedure,
you must have an S3 bucket in which to store the backups.

1. In <%= vars.ops_manager %>, open the <%= vars.product_short %> tile **Backups** pane.

1. Select **Ceph or Amazon S3**.

    <img alt="Backup configuration pane shows Ceph or Amazon S3 selected and the fields
    in the pane are described in the table below."
    width="400" src="./images/S3-backups.png"/>

1. Configure the fields as follows:

            <td>
                Enter the S3 Access Key ID and Secret Access Key that you created in
                <a href="#access-key-aws">Create a Custom Policy and Access Key</a> above.

                <strong>Endpoint URL</strong>
            </td>
            <td>
                Enter the S3-compatible endpoint URL for uploading backups. <br>
                The URL must start with <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code>. <br>
                The default is <code>https://s3.amazonaws.com</code>.<br>
                If you are using a public S3 endpoint, see the S3 Endpoint procedure in

                Do not include an <code>s3://</code> prefix, a trailing <code>/</code>, or underscores.
                VMware recommends using the naming convention <code>DEPLOYMENT-backups</code>.
                For example, <code>sandbox-backups</code>.

                <strong>Note:</strong> If you are using a blobstore that uses a specific set of domains in its

## <a id="gcs"></a> Back Up to GCS

When you configure backups for a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket,
<%= vars.product_short %> runs a GCS SDK that saves backups to a GCS bucket.

  For information about GCS buckets,
  see the [GCS documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/).

To back up your database to Google Cloud Storage (GCS):

### <a id="service-account-gcs"></a> Create a Service Account and Private Key

<%= vars.product_short %> accesses your GCS bucket through a service account.

The service account needs the following permissions:

* List and upload to buckets
* (Optional) Create buckets if they do not already exist

To create a service account and private key in GCS:

1. Create a new service account by following this procedure in

When you create the service account:
      1. Enter a unique name for the service account name.

                Test your cron expression using a website such as
