You can obtain the health status for each node
in a MySQL database cluster node that is in a highly available (HA) cluster plan.

If you cannot write or connect to your app, you should
check the health status of your nodes. You can observe the health status of nodes through a proxy
using the Switchboard dashboard or API endpoint. You can also view the number of client connections
routed through a proxy to each node.

For more information about proxies, see [MySQL Proxy](./about-ha.html#proxy).
