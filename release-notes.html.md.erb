<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

VMware recommends that you upgrade to the latest patch available for your current minor,
and then upgrade to the latest patch available for the next minor.

<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + '/upgrade-planner' %>

Because VMware uses the Percona Distribution for MySQL, expect a time lag between Oracle releasing a
MySQL patch and VMware releasing <%= vars.product_full %> containing that patch.

## <a id="3-2-0"></a> v3.3.0

**Release Date: TBD**

<p class="note important">
<span class="note__title">Important</span>
3.1.x is the last version of <%= vars.product_full %> that supports MySQL 5.7.
<%= vars.product_short %> 3.2.0 and later only support MySQL 8.0. If you are upgrading from an earlier release of <%= vars.product_short %>, you must reconfigure any plans previously configured with "MySQL Default Version" of 5.7 to specify 8.0. For more information about upgrading <%= vars.product_short %>, see <a href="./upgrade.html">Upgrading VMware SQL with MySQL for Tanzu Application Service</a>.
</p>

This release includes the following changes:

* The bootstrap errand no longer requires an `--instance` designation when run; it self-selects a
high-availability cluster instance node to run on.
* A number of high and critical CVEs were addressed by updating the components to the latest version

### Breaking Changes

* **MySQL v5.7 is no longer supported.**:

  Existing service plans that used a "MySQL Default Version" of "5.7" must be updated. Any service instance created with one of these plans will be updated to MySQL 8.0 when the instance is upgraded. For more information about upgrading <%= vars.product_short %>, see [Upgrading VMware SQL with MySQL for Tanzu Application Service](./upgrade.html).
