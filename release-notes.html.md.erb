<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

VMware recommends that you upgrade to the latest patch available for your current minor,
and then upgrade to the latest patch available for the next minor.

<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + '/upgrade-planner' %>

Because VMware uses the Percona Distribution for MySQL, expect a time lag between Oracle releasing a
MySQL patch and VMware releasing <%= vars.product_full %> containing that patch.

## <a id="3-3-0"></a> v3.3.0

**Release Date: May 23, 2024**

<p class="note important">
<span class="note__title">Important</span>
3.1.x is the last version of <%= vars.product_full %> that supports MySQL 5.7.
<%= vars.product_short %> 3.2.0 and later only support MySQL 8.0. If you are upgrading from an earlier release of <%= vars.product_short %>, you must reconfigure any plans previously configured with "MySQL Default Version" of 5.7 to specify 8.0. For more information about upgrading <%= vars.product_short %>, see <a href="./upgrade.html">Upgrading VMware SQL with MySQL for Tanzu Application Service</a>.

### Changes

This release includes the following changes:

* Backups and restores use less persistent disk space thanks to a new streaming format (xbstream) and more efficient compression (zstd).
* Users can restore into a non-empty database.
* The bootstrap errand self-selects a high-availability cluster instance node on which to run, and no longer requires the `--instance` flag.

### Performance Improvements
With the introduction of a more efficient compression algorithm, backup performance has substantially improved.

Benchmark tests were performed using a publicly available dataset sample of around 150 GiB, using a range of compute configurations (2 core / 2GB, 4 core / 16GB, 8 core / 64GB). Under those parameters, upgrading to version 3.3.0 of <%= vars.product_full %> resulted in approximately 8X faster backups, and 13% smaller backup artifacts when compared against version 3.2.1.

>**Important**
>These estimates are based on a limited set of testing, against an arbitrary dataset using hardware that is representative of a few, but not inclusive of all, use cases and workloads.
>Real performance will be unique to your specific use case and application.

### Breaking Changes

This release includes the following breaking changes:

* **MySQL v5.7 is no longer supported.**

  Existing service plans that used a "MySQL Default Version" of "5.7" must be updated. Any service instance created with one of these plans will be updated to MySQL 8.0 when the instance is upgraded. For more information about upgrading <%= vars.product_short %>, see [Upgrading VMware SQL with MySQL for Tanzu Application Service](./upgrade.html).
