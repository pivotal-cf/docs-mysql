<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

VMware recommends that you upgrade to the latest patch for your current minor,
and then upgrade to the latest available patch for the next minor.

<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + '/upgrade-planner' %>

Because VMware uses the Percona Distribution for MySQL,
expect a time lag between Oracle releasing a MySQL patch and VMware releasing
Tanzu SQL with MySQL for VMs containing that patch.

### Security Fixes

This release includes the following security fix:

  and multi-site instances do not have any externally available admin interfaces.

### Resolved Issues

  Previously, the adbr plugin accepted all TLS connections, regardless of version.

+ **Smoke test errands no longer leave orphan routes:**
   Do a one-time cleanup of orphan routes from earlier versions of Tanzu SQL with MySQL for VMs by running:
  
    ```
    cf target -o ORG -s pivotal-services
    cf delete-orphaned-routes
    ```
    Where is `ORG` is ....

## <a id="2-10-3"></a> v2.10.3

**Release Date: May 28, 2021**

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong>
The breaking change listed for v2.10.0 also applies if you are upgrading from v2.9 to v2.10.3.
See <a href="#2-10-0">Breaking Change</a> below.
</p>

### Features

New feature in this release:

+ **List as many backups as needed:**
  Previously, the Application Developer Backup and Restore (ADBR) plugin always listed the five most recent backups.

    Now, the ADBR plugin accepts an integer parameter to specify how many backups to list.
    The plugin continues to list five backups by default.

    To install the new plugin, see [ApplicationDataBackupRestore](https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org/#ApplicationDataBackupRestore)
    on the Cloud Foundry Community cf CLI Plugins website.
    For how to use the new limit parameter,
    see [Procedure to Restore a Service Instance](backup-restore.html#procedure)
    in _Backing Up and Restoring_.

+ **Configure backup location with bucket path:**
  The tile now accepts an optional field for bucket path.
  This allows backups to be stored with a path like:
  `p.mysql > BUCKET-PATH > service-instance_GUID > yyyy > mm > dd`.

    Previously, the Application Developer Backup and Restore (ADBR) feature stored backup
    artifacts with a path like:
    `p.mysql > service-instance_GUID > yyyy > mm > dd`.

    Existing backup artifacts can still be accessed through the cf CLI using the `adbr` plugin.

    To configure a bucket path, follow the procedure for your external storage solution in
    [Configuring Automated Backups](./automated-backup.html).

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fix:

+ **ADBR API only accepts TLS 1.2 connections**:
  Previously, the ADBR API accepted all TLS connections, regardless of version.

### Known Issues

<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + "/mysql/disable-plan-ki" %>

## <a id="2-10-2"></a> v2.10.2

**Release Date: March 11, 2021**

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong>
The breaking change listed for v2.10.0 also applies if you are upgrading from v2.9 to v2.10.2.
See <a href="#2-10-0">Breaking Change</a> below.
</p>

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

+ **Support Instance Profiles for backups to S3:**
  <%= vars.product_short %> now supports using instance profiles for backups to Amazon S3.
  <br>
  This is enabled by a radio button on the **Backups** pane of the **<%= vars.product_full %>** tile. Configuring the fields under this option allows for backups to Amazon S3 without
  using static credentials.
  For more information, see
  [Back Up to Amazon S3 with Instance Profile](automated-backup.html#instance-profile).

+ **Avoid filling up the Persistent Disk with Binary Logs:**
  A checkbox restricts the space that binary logs can use on the persistent disk.
  For databases with a high transaction rate, this change prevents database failures due
  to the disk running out of space.
  For more information,
  see [Limit binary log disk use to 33% of disk capacity](./install-config.html#limit-disk-use)
  in _Installing and Configuring_.

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fix:

+ **ADBR does not show error "Status during Restore Operation"**:
  Previously, the ADBR plugin showed an error status during a restore when the database was unavailable.
  Now, the ADBR plugin reports the restore status as being in progress.

### Known Issues

This release has the following issue:

<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + "/mysql/disable-plan-ki" %>

### Resolved Issues

## <a id="2-10-0"></a> v2.10.0

**Release Date: December 8, 2020**

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change</strong>:
Before you upgrade to <%= vars.product_full %> v2.10, make sure that
your apps support connecting to the MySQL database using TLS v1.2.
This might require updating the MySQL connector.
For example, if you are using MySQL Connector/J,
use MySQL Connector/J v8.0.8 or later or v5.1.44 or later.
</p>

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

+ **External access to the MySQL database through Service-Gateway:** By enabling service-gateway access,
  operators and developers can allow MySQL service instances to be accessed from outside
  <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> platform.
  For more information, see [About Service-Gateway Access](./service-gateway-access.html).

+ **Option to restrict MySQL client connections to TLS v1.2:** When TLS is enabled,
  operators can choose to enforce TLS v1.2 as the minimum TLS version for client connections.
  Connections that use the TLS v1.1 protocol or older are then rejected by the MySQL server.
  For more information, see [Configure TLS](install-config.html#security-tls)
  in _Installing and Configuring_.

+ **Backup artifacts are organized under subfolders in external storage:** Previously, the Application
  Developer Backup and Restore (ADBR) feature stored backup artifacts in the root directory in external storage.
  For easier navigation, backup artifacts are now stored under
  `p.mysql > service-instance_GUID > yyyy > mm > dd`.
  Old backup artifacts stored in the root directory can still be accessed through the cf CLI
  using the adbr plugin.

+ **<%= vars.single_leader_plan %> GA:** The <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> feature is officially generally available in
  this release. There have been no changes to the feature since v2.9.1.

+ **Percona Server:** Upgraded to v5.7.31–34.

+ **Percona XtraDB Cluster:** Upgraded to v5.7.31–34.

### Known Issues
