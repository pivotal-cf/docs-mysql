<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

VMware recommends that you upgrade to the latest patch available for your current minor,
and then upgrade to the latest patch available for the next minor.

<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + '/upgrade-planner' %>

Because VMware uses the Percona Distribution for MySQL, expect a time lag between Oracle releasing a
MySQL patch and VMware releasing <%= vars.product_full %> containing that patch.

## <a id="3-1-1"></a> v3.1.1

**Release Date: Oct 26th, 2023**


>**Important**
> 3.1.x is the last version of <%= vars.product_full %> that supports MySQL 5.7.

### Resolved Issues

This release resolves the following issues:

+ A number of high and critical CVEs were addressed by updating the components to the latest version.

* Users who upgraded multi-site deployments from previous versions to 3.1.0 could experience leader/follower connectivity issues upon switchover. This release addresses that behavior.


* Fixed an issue where smoke tests could time out prematurely when a high availability plan is configured as the first plan in the MySQL Tile.


* Fixed a high-availability proxy dashboard access issue.

## <a id="3-1-0"></a> v3.1.0

**Release Date: Oct 4th, 2023**

This release allows application developers to set up multi-site plans between <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> foundations without the need for platform engineers to make the foundations routable.

>**Important**
> 3.1.x is the last version of <%= vars.product_full %> that supports MySQL 5.7.

### Resolved Issues

This release resolves the following issues:

+ **MySQL service bindings support MariaDB Connector/J v3.0 and later:**:

  MariaDB Connector/J 3.0 and later, by default, accept only `jdbc:mariadb` connection strings.

  In service bindings created by the MySQL tile, the `jdbcUrl` parameter now includes the `permitMysqlScheme` option. This ensures that apps that use MariaDB Connector/J 3.0 and later are compatible with MySQL tile service bindings.

+ Removes obsolete `syslog_migration_selector` certificates field. The certificates eventually expire, causing a certificate flag in <%= vars.ops_manager %>, but the field was hidden, so manual intervention was required to address the flag.

+ Fixes an issue where users were unable to delete service keys created for MySQL 8.0 service instances with single-node or leader-follower topologies.

### Changes

This release includes the following changes:

+ Adds dynamic configuration of wsrep_applier_threads. For information about
this configuration, see [WSREP applier threads](./change-default.html#wsrep_applier_threads) in _Changing Defaults Using Arbitrary Parameters_.

+ Sets `wsrep_applier_threads` value based on available CPUs to improve throughput.

+ To support named time zones, time zone information is now loaded into the MySQL system database by default. For information about how to use this feature, see the [MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/time-zone-support.html).

+ Adds service-gateway support to multi-site topologies. For more information, see [About enabling external access](./about-multi-site.html#enable-external-access) in _About multi-site replication_.

### Breaking Changes

+ **Percona 8.0.22: DROP USER fails with an error if any account to be dropped is named as the DEFINER attribute for any stored object.:**:

  This release addresses this breaking change in Percona. Deleting a service key no longer results in a failure when the user associated with the service key has been used to create stored objects.
  Instead, as in previous releases, the objects will be orphaned.
