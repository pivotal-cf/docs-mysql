<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

VMware recommends that you upgrade to the latest patch available for your current minor,
and then upgrade to the latest patch available for the next minor.

<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + '/upgrade-planner' %>

Because VMware uses the Percona Distribution for MySQL, expect a time lag between Oracle releasing a
MySQL patch and VMware releasing <%= vars.product_full %> containing that patch.
