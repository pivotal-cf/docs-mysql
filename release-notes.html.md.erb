<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

VMware recommends that you upgrade to the latest patch available for your current minor,
and then upgrade to the latest patch available for the next minor.

<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + '/upgrade-planner' %>

Because VMware uses the Percona Distribution for MySQL, expect a time lag between Oracle releasing a
MySQL patch and VMware releasing <%= vars.product_full %> containing that patch.

**Release Date: April 4th, 2023**

### Changes

This release includes the following changes:

+ The product has been renamed to VMware SQL with MySQL for Tanzu Application Service.
+ The number of available service plans has increased from 9 to 18.
+ Support for MySQL 5.7 and 8.0: a new **MySQL Default Version** field for service plans enables operators to select either MySQL 5.7 or MySQL 8.0 as the default version for service instances created using the plan.
+ Support for Ubuntu Jammy stemcells
+ Ubuntu Jammy stemcells require TLS v1.2.
+ For HA service instances, all nodes use TLS for internal communication.
+ Service instance upgrades:
	+ If the **Upgrade all On-demand MySQL Service Instances** post-deploy errand is enabled, all service instances will be automatically updated or upgraded:
		+ All service instances using a service plan with a **MySQL Default Version** setting of MySQL 5.7 will be automatically updated to run MySQL 5.7 on Ubuntu Jammy.
		+ All service instances using a service plan with a **MySQL Default Version** setting of MySQL 8.0 will be automatically upgraded to run MySQL 5.7 on Ubuntu Jammy.
	+ If the **Upgrade all On-demand MySQL Service Instances** post-deploy errand is disabled, no service instances will be automatically updated or upgraded:
		+ Developers can update a service instance to run on Ubuntu Jammy by running `cf update-service --upgrade`.
		+ Developers can upgrade a service instance to run MySQL 8.0 on Ubuntu Jammy by running `cf update-service -p` and specifying a service plan that has **MySQL Default Version** set to MySQL 8.0.
+ VM extensions: a new field for service plans enables operators to configure a list of custom VM extensions that apply to VMs for service instances created using the plan.

### Known Issues

+ Setting **TLS Options** to **Required** enables TLS communication between apps and MySQL service instances, but does not enforce it.

## Breaking changes

This release includes the following breaking changes:

+ The `enable_tls` property has been renamed to `enforce_client_tls`.
