## <a id="2-7-8"></a> v2.7.8

**Release Date: May 20, 2020**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

+ **Filenames for backup artifacts include an instance UUID:**
Operators can use this UUID to differentiate between the leader and follower backup artifacts.

+ **Developers can enable lowercase table names when they update service instances:**
If an operator selects **Allow Developers To Override Lower Case Table Names** in the tile,
developers can enable and disable the `lower_case_table_names` property when they update a service instance.
Previously, they could only enable this feature when they created a service instance.

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fixes:

+ **Smoke tests no longer fail with a timeout:**
  Previously, if you had many buildpacks in your environment, smoke tests sometimes failed.

+ **Broker requests no longer fail:** Previously, if a developer bound a
<%= vars.product_short %> v2.6 service instance using <%= vars.product_short %> v2.7,
broker requests failed. In this case, developers could not bind or update service instances.

+ **Enable Lower Case Table Names no longer
enables the feature on existing service instances:**
Previously, if a developer selected **Enable Lower Case Table Names** in the tile,
existing tables with uppercase names were orphaned.
Now, if the feature is enabled in the tile,
**Enable Lower Case Table Names** is only applied to new service instances.

+ **Leader-follower backups are no longer overwritten:**
Previously, <%= vars.product_short %> sometimes only stored one backup file from a random node.
Now, <%= vars.product_short %> uploads both the leader and follower backup artifacts to the blobstore.

**Release Date: February 24, 2020**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

between a highly available (HA) cluster plan and a plan of another topology.
