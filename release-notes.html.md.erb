<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

VMware recommends that you upgrade to the latest patch available for your current minor,
and then upgrade to the latest patch available for the next minor.

<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + '/upgrade-planner' %>

Because VMware uses the Percona Distribution for MySQL, expect a time lag between Oracle releasing a
MySQL patch and VMware releasing <%= vars.product_full %> containing that patch.

**Release Date: TBD**


### Resolved Issues

This release resolves the following issues:

+ **MySQL service bindings support MariaDB Connector/J v3.0 and later:**:

  MariaDB Connector/J 3.0 and later, by default, accept only `jdbc:mariadb` connection strings.

  In service bindings created by the MySQL tile, the `jdbcUrl` parameter now includes the `permitMysqlScheme` option. This ensures that apps that use MariaDB Connector/J 3.0 and later are compatible with MySQL tile service bindings.



### Changes

This release includes the following changes:

+ Adds dynamic configuration of wsrep_applier_threads. For information about
this configuration, see [WSREP applier threads](./change-default.html#wsrep_applier_threads) in _Changing Defaults Using Arbitrary Parameters_.

### Breaking Changes

+ **Percona 8.0.22: DROP USER fails with an error if any account to be dropped is named as the DEFINER attribute for any stored object.:**:

  This release addresses this breaking change in Percona. Deleting a service key no longer results in a failure when the user associated with the service key has been used to create stored objects.
  Instead, as in previous releases, the objects will be orphaned.

### Compatibility

TBD
